# Next steps

* specify the problem with using just preferential attachment for social networks (clustering coefficient etc.)
* refactor code once more and find better way to interpolate from Barabasi-Albert model
* formulate hypotheses
* do numerical analysis -> see if this model solves the problem (or at least is an improvement)
* think about ways to obtain actual network data (plan B: just make predictions, but that would be kind of unsatisfying)
